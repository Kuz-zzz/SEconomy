SEconomy - Server-sided currency, economy and ranking system for TShock servers

## Message from [Wolfje](https://github.com/tylerjwatson/) (The original creator)
*I'd hate to do have to finally do this, but SEconomy and Jist has been a lot of work to maintain, and I am the only person that maintains their codebases. SEconomy is always going to be open-source and free, but it now costs me money to host and my time that I have for SEconomy has far waned since the project began: SEconomy has outgrown a project for fun into a fully-fledged piece of software that requires a lot of effort to maintain and keep stable.*

*I have not made a single cent off the development of SEconomy, Jist, or any other plugin, whereas I have enabled server owners to make thousands. So please, if you use my software I would encourage you to donate to ensure the continued support for SEconomy, particularly if your server profits from my ranking system or currency; it would really help me out and give me some extra sweet thanks for my effort.*
